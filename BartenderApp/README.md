# My Bartender app

This application was completed as a school assignment.

This is a simple bartender app where the user can choose from a list of drinks, and place an order
with their name. The order will appear in the queue so the bartender can fulfill the drinks in the 
order they are placed. Once the order is complete, the bartender will complete the order on the queue 
page and announce the name to the customers so the order can be retrieved. The customer will pay for 
their drinks at the time of pick-up. 

Currently there are no admin features. I would like to update the app so that when the customer sees the
queue, they do not have the option of pressing the "done" button. They can only see where in the queue
their order is. Only the bartenders will have the ability to fulfill the orders on the queue page. 

I imagined this as a very simple app that a customer could use upon entering a bar and there being a tablet
to order from, instead of crowding around other people in hopes the bartender takes their order next. 
As most bars are dark instead, I chose a black background so that it would not be so jarring to the 
customer and their eyes would not have to adjust. There will also not be a glaring bright tablet in the
room every time someone places an order.

This app is written in C# with HTML/CSS using ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework.
The photo at the top of the page serves as the "Home" button to return the user to the Home/Index.cshtml page.
A local database was used.
